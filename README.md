Our goal was to determine the effects of weather and time on taxi ridership, as well as the ways in which taxi drivers can use specific trip-related information available to them to maximize their monetary profits. 

Therefore, the final dataset used to construct the model merges data from two online sources: NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission and National Climatic Data Center.   

As of now, data originating from the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) provides historical data on taxi services from January 2009 to June 2018. This data encompasses both yellow taxi and green taxi trip records; however, owing to the huge size of the dataset, for our purposes, trip records only involving yellow taxis were utilized. The trip records are contained in CSV files, each of which includes trip data from a particular month of the year.

As of now, data originating from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) provides historical data on weather and climate in the United States for the last 30 years.  This data provides a comprehensive selection of variables pertinent to weather -- including, but not limited to, daily maximum/minimum temperature, snowfall, and precipitation level. The weather records are contained in CSV files, each of which includes daily weather data from a particular month of the year.
